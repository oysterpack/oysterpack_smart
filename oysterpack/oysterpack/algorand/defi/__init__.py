"""
1. Defines standard high level interfaces for Algorand DeFi protocols
2. Defines ABI ARC-4 smart contract interfaces for Algorand DeFi protocols
   that can be used to construct a beaker `ApplicationClient` to interact
   the DeFi protocol contracts.
3. Provides smart contracts that implement standardized DeFi protocols.

For example, standard interfaces for AMM DEX and lending protocols would be defined.
DeFi protocol adapters will be provided to integrate with the specific DeFi protocols.
This makes it easier to compose and integrate DeFi protocols.
